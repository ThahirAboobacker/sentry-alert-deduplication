# 🛡️ Sentry - SuperHack 2025 Submission

**Team:** Hackathon Team  
**Category:** Service Efficiency Improvement  
**Platform:** SuperOps AI Integration  

## 🎯 Problem Statement

MSPs and IT teams are drowning in **alert fatigue**. A single infrastructure incident can generate 50+ duplicate and low-priority alerts, overwhelming technicians and masking real critical issues. This leads to:

- Delayed incident response times
- Missed critical alerts in the noise
- Technician burnout and reduced productivity
- Poor customer SLAs during outages

## 💡 Our Solution: Sentry Alert Deduplication Engine

Sentry is an AI-powered alert filtering system that sits between SuperOps monitoring and IT teams, intelligently reducing alert noise by **82%** while ensuring **zero critical alerts are missed**.

### Core Innovation
- **Smart Deduplication**: Groups identical alerts within 5-minute windows using content fingerprinting
- **Intelligent Noise Suppression**: Filters low-priority, informational, and already-resolved alerts
- **Critical Alert Protection**: Never suppresses alerts containing "critical", "outage", "down", "failed"
- **Real-time Processing**: Processes alerts instantly via webhook integration

## 📊 Demonstrated Results

### Hackathon Demo Scenario: Major Database Outage
- **Before Sentry**: 72 alerts flood the IT team
- **After Sentry**: 13 critical alerts requiring attention
- **Noise Reduction**: **82%** (exceeds 80% target ✅)
- **Duplicates Eliminated**: 39 alerts (54% of total)
- **Critical Alerts Missed**: **0** (100% accuracy ✅)

### Business Impact
- IT team focuses on **13 real issues** instead of **72 alerts**
- **82% reduction** in alert fatigue and notification overload
- **Faster incident response** during critical outages
- **Zero false negatives** - all critical issues properly escalated
